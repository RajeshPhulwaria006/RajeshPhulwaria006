# 👋 Hi, I'm Rajesh Phulwaria

I'm a **Computer Science student from India** focused on building real skills in  
**Machine Learning, Python development, and problem-solving through projects**.

I don’t chase buzzwords : I learn by building, breaking, and improving things.

---

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Doing
- Deepening **Machine Learning fundamentals** (especially time-series & classification)
- Practicing **Python through projects**, not tutorials
- Improving **Git/GitHub workflow** (commits, debugging, iteration)
- Gradually preparing for **open-source contribution standards**

---

## 🧠 Technical Skills (Work in Progress)
**Languages**
- Python
- C++
- JavaScript (basic)

**Machine Learning**
- LSTM & time-series basics
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Model evaluation & data preprocessing

**Development**
- Pygame
- Basic Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📌 Featured Projects
> These repositories represent **hands-on learning**, not polished commercial products.

### 🤖 Jarvis AI Chatbot
- Python-based chatbot project
- Focus on logic flow, responses, and basic automation concepts
- Helped me understand how AI systems are *structured*, not magically built

### 📈 Stock Price Predictor (LSTM)
- Time-series prediction using **LSTM**
- Learned about:
  - Data normalization
  - Sequence windows
  - Overfitting in deep learning
- Clear example of applying ML beyond textbook datasets

### 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website
- Built to showcase my projects and learning journey
- Uses HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript
- Reinforced frontend fundamentals and deployment awareness

### 🎮 Snake Game (Pygame)
- Classic Snake game built using **Pygame**
- Strengthened understanding of:
  - Game loops
  - Event handling
  - State management
- Proof that I can translate logic into working programs

---

## 📖 How I Approach Learning
- I prioritize **concept clarity over shortcuts**
- I debug issues instead of deleting code
- I document mistakes so I don’t repeat them
- I prefer **small, complete projects** over half-finished “big ideas”

---

## 🎯 Short-Term Goals
- Write **cleaner, more structured Python**
- Improve ML intuition (why models fail, not just when they work)
- Make my repositories **contribution-ready**
- Start contributing to beginner-friendly open-source projects

---

## 📫 Contact & Info
- Location: India 🇮🇳
- GitHub: You’re already here
- Open to: learning collaborations, feedback, and constructive criticism
